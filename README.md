Omnible-new
===========

<b>Unofficial</b> Android Application to access the Omnivox web student portal used by most CÉGEPs in Quebec, Canada. Omnivox allows students to communicate with each other, and to receive documents from teachers and from the school.

I am not affiliated with Skytech Communications in any way. This app is newly released and may be buggy. You have been warned. Other schools and french support is upcoming. (I am open to ideas to which shchools to support next! Contact me!)

<b>The app currently supports the following schools:</b>
- Marianopolis College
- Vanier College
- Dawson College
- John Abott College
- Champlain College St-Lambert
- Collège de Maisonneuve
- CÉGEP de St-Laurent

<b>Permissions required and explaination:</b>

-INTERNET: Access Omnivox online

-WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Download files from Léa and Mio

<b>Privacy and behind the scenes:</b>
This app is actually a web browser that pretends to be an iPhone (by changing its user-agent), in order to get the official mobile version of Omnivox that is currently only available for Apple devices. The app may store your session so you will be logged in automatically, and your session information may be passed on to Android's Download Manager in order to allow you to download files.
<b>This app does not store or access your student ID or password, ever, except to login to Omnivox.</b>

The app is developed in Android Studio 0.5.1. Just import the project into the IDE, there should be no extra dependencies.
